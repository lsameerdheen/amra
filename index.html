All science is built upon this search; we investigate how crystals aggregate; how atoms are fastened together; 
how electrons constitute a chemical bond between atoms; how the cell is built of reticular material, cytoplasm, chromosomes. We like to understand, and to explain, observed facts
 in terms of structure. A chemist who understands why a diamond has certain properties, or why nylon or hemoglobin have other properties, because of the different ways their atoms are arranged, 
may ask questions that a geologist would not think of formulating, unless he had been similarly trained in this way of thinking about the world.
